"Question","Answer"
"How can I apply for admission at Superior University on-campus?","To apply on-campus, visit the admission office at your chosen Superior University campus. There you can consult with admissions staff, pay the prospectus/application fee, and complete the application form. You will then receive an admission test/interview slip and must take the university's entry test (and interview, if required). Once you pass, you will get an offer letter and a fee challan. Finally, submit the paid fee slip along with your academic documents to complete the enrollment process."
"How can I apply online for admission at Superior University?","To apply online, go to Superior University's official website and click ""Apply Now"" (which leads to the ERP admission portal). Create an account (using your CNIC or passport number and a valid email) and log in. Fill out the online application form with all required details. Download the generated fee voucher and pay the admission fee (online or at any designated bank). After payment, upload the payment slip as instructed. The portal will then provide you with a reference number and inform you about your entry-test/interview schedule."
"What documents do I need to submit for admission?","Typically, you must submit your academic certificates and transcripts (for example: Matric and Intermediate for BS applicants, bachelor’s degree for MS applicants), your CNIC or passport (and B-Form for underage applicants), domicile certificate, and recent passport-size photographs. International or transfer students may also need equivalence or migration certificates. These documents (along with the paid fee receipt) should be submitted to the Admissions Office on your chosen campus when you complete your registration."
"What are the eligibility criteria for undergraduate (BS) programs?","Undergraduate (BS) applicants must have completed 12 years of schooling (F.Sc, ICS, A-Levels or equivalent). Most BS programs require a minimum percentage (often around 50%) in the Intermediate or equivalent exams. Some programs may have specific subject prerequisites (for example, science background for engineering majors). Generally, if you hold an Intermediate degree with the required marks, you are eligible to apply to the corresponding BS program."
"What are the eligibility criteria for postgraduate (MS/MPhil) programs?","Postgraduate programs (MS or MPhil) generally require a relevant four-year bachelor’s degree (16 years of education) from an accredited university. You usually need a solid academic record (often a minimum CGPA or percentage; many programs expect around 60% or an equivalent grade). Some programs may require you to have a specific undergraduate major or to have taken certain courses. Additionally, you must pass the university’s entry test (e.g. the NTS GAT Subject or Superior’s own entrance test) as part of meeting the requirements."
"What are the eligibility criteria for PhD programs?","PhD applicants typically must hold an MS or MPhil (18 years of education) in a related field, with excellent grades (often a first division or CGPA ≥ 3.0). In addition to the academic requirements, candidates must pass the entry test and an interview. Superior University explicitly requires all aspiring postgraduate and PhD candidates to participate in its Entry Test:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, so passing this exam is part of the eligibility. Fulfillment of these criteria is required for PhD admission."
"Is there an entry test for admission?","Yes, Superior University conducts an entry test for all applicants. In fact, an official announcement for 2024 explicitly invited *all aspiring undergraduate and postgraduate students* to take the university’s Entry Test:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}. You must register for this test and achieve a qualifying score (subject to program requirements) as part of the admission process. Exact test dates and syllabus are posted on the official website each semester."
"Are there any exemptions from the entry test?","The admission guidelines do not list any general exemptions. In most cases, all candidates (undergraduate or postgraduate) are expected to take the Entry Test. If you have a special circumstance (for example, a very high prior qualification or a qualifying score on an equivalent test), you should directly consult the admissions office. But normally, plan to sit the entry test as part of your application."
"Do I need to attend an interview as part of the admission process?","Yes, many programs include an interview after the entry test. On-campus and online applicants who pass the entry test are usually invited to a personal interview with the department. This interview helps the faculty assess your fit for the program. If you pass both the test and interview, you will be offered admission."
"How do I use the Superior University admission portal (ERP)?","The online admission portal is accessed via the official website (click ""Apply Now"" on the homepage). To use it, create a login account with your CNIC (or passport) and a valid email, then enter your personal details on the application form. Once you submit the form, the portal will generate a fee payment voucher. Pay the fee (online or at a designated bank), then upload or submit the payment slip as instructed. The portal will then display your reference number, and you will be notified of your test/interview schedule."
"What should I do if I forget my portal password or face login issues?","If you forget your password, use the ""Reset Password"" link on the portal login page and follow the instructions (you may need to verify via your email or CNIC). For other technical issues, make sure you are using a compatible browser (Google Chrome is recommended). If problems persist, contact the admissions support or technical assistance through the contact information provided on the website."
"Where can I find the fee structure for my program?","Superior University provides detailed fee structures on its website. Look for the ""Fee Structure"" section under Academics or Admissions. That page lists tuition fees per credit hour, registration charges, and any additional fees for each program or faculty. If you cannot find it online, you can request a copy from the admissions office or download it if available (some fee schedules are provided on program pages or the admissions portal)."
"What are the admission deadlines and timelines for the Fall and Spring intakes?","Superior University typically has two intakes: Fall and Spring. The exact deadlines vary by year and program. For example, Spring 2025 admissions are currently open:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}, with classes likely starting in January/February 2025. Fall admissions usually open in mid-year for classes starting around August/September (for instance, Fall 2024 classes began in October 2024). Admissions usually close a few weeks before classes start. Check the official website or contact admissions each semester for the final application closing dates, as they can change."
"What merit-based scholarships are available for new students?","The university offers merit scholarships for high achievers in HSSC (or equivalent) and DAE exams. For HSSC/A-Levels: students who are in the top 3 positions or score above 95% receive a 100% tuition waiver. Those with 90–94% marks get a 75% waiver, 75–89% get a 50% waiver, and 60–74% get a 25% waiver. A-Level students receive similar awards (percentage-based). For DAE (Diploma) holders: 75%+ marks earn a 50% waiver, and 60–74% earn a 25% waiver. These scholarships are automatic based on your exam results – you don’t need to apply separately."
"What is the Dean's PhD Scholarship?","The Dean's PhD Scholarship is an award for outstanding PhD students. It typically provides tuition assistance (and sometimes a stipend) to help PhD candidates focus on their research and teaching skills under faculty mentorship. This scholarship is usually awarded based on merit among the PhD candidates. For detailed terms, eligibility, and application process, you should inquire with the Graduate Studies office or the Dean of Graduate Studies."
"What is the Ch. Muhammad Akram Qarz-e-Hasna Scholarship?","The Ch. Muhammad Akram Qarz-e-Hasna scholarship is actually an interest-free loan program offered by the university. Deserving students can receive financial aid for their education with the understanding that they will repay it after graduating. Essentially, the university covers their tuition upfront, and the student repays the loan to the university after completing their degree (often the degree certificate is issued only once the loan is cleared). For more details on eligibility and the application process for this loan, contact the admissions or financial aid office."
"How do I apply for scholarships at Superior University?","Most merit scholarships (like those based on high exam scores) are awarded automatically when you meet the criteria, so you usually do not need to apply separately. For example, if your HSSC/DAE marks qualify you for a waiver, it will be applied to your account when you enroll. For specialized awards such as the Dean’s PhD Scholarship or the Qarz-e-Hasna loan, you may need to submit an additional application or meet specific requirements set by the university. Contact the admissions or financial aid office for guidance on how to apply for those special programs."
"How can I contact the admissions office for help or more information?","You can reach Superior University admissions support via phone or email. The admissions helpline is **042-38103777** and the admissions email is **cms@superior.edu.pk**:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. This line operates during campus hours for inquiries about admission procedures, documents, scholarships, deadlines, etc. You can also visit the campus in person for counseling or use the live chat service on the university website for quick questions."
"Is there an applicant portal where I can check my admission status?","Yes. After you apply (online or in person), you can use the ERP admission portal to check your application status. Log in with your account to see updates, such as whether your documents have been received or if an offer letter has been issued. If you applied on-campus, you might receive status updates via email/SMS, but the portal is the primary way to track your admission progress."
"When will I know if I have been admitted?","After you take the entry test and attend the interview, the results are typically communicated to successful applicants via the admission portal, email, and SMS. Admitted students usually receive an official offer letter within a few days to a couple of weeks after their test/interview. The university may also publish merit lists on campus notice boards or online. If you don’t hear back in a timely manner, you can follow up with the admissions office."
